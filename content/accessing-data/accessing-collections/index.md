> This user guide uses 'portal' to refer to the interface across all of the available Oni portals (see [Available Portals](/getting-started/available-portals/) for more details).

### Apply for Access to a Collection

When viewing an object that has restricted access, you will see one of the following permission warnings, depending on whether or not you are logged in to the portal:
- You do not have permission to see these files. Sign up or Login
- You do not have permission to see these files. You are logged in and you can apply for permission to view these files apply for access or refresh permissions

<br>

Once you have logged in (see [Login](/accessing-data/login/) for further details), select ___apply for access___ in the warning text and you will be directed to the LDaCA REMS in a new tab; this is a resource management system for collections listed in the portal. Select ___Login___ and follow the CILogon prompts (see [Login](/accessing-data/login/) again).

TODO more wording about the interface needed here. Also need description of top menu bar functions (Catalogue, Applications, About etc).

There are five sections on the main interface:
- __State__: TODO description
- __Applicants__: TODO description
- __Resources__: TODO description
- __Licenses__: TODO description
- __Actions__: TODO description

TODO next steps

### View your Current Access List

To view your current list of licences you have access to, hover your cursor over the arrow next to your account name to trigger a dropdown menu and select ___User Information___. If you are not logged in, see the steps under [Login](/accessing-data/login/). The _User Memberships_ section shows your current access list, and you can click ___Check Memberships___ to refresh this list.
