You will be taken to the CILogon page which:
- provides details of the _Consent to Attribute Release_
- allows you to select an identity provider

CILogon facilitates secure access to CyberInfrastructure (CI). In order to use the CILogon Service, you must first select an identity provider. An identity provider (IdP) is an organization where you have an account and can log on to gain access to online services.

If you are a faculty, staff, or student member of a university or college, please select it for your identity provider. If your school is not listed, please contact help@cilogon.org, and we will try to add your school in the future. If you have a ORCID, Google, GitHub or Microsoft account, you can select it for authenticating to the CILogon Service.

For further details about CILogon and the identity providers it supports, see [CILogon FAQ](https://www.cilogon.org/faq).

The dropdown on your account name has the options:
- ___User Information___: View your user details and memberships to collections that have more specific access conditions.
- ___Logout___: Select to log out of your account.
