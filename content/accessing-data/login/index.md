Some collections require that you login either to access or apply for access to the data. This can be done by selecting ___Login___ from the top menu bar.

You will be taken to the _LDaCAData_ logon page. Select ___Sign in with CILogon___.

Once your login is successful, you will be redirected back to the Portal page and the ___Login___ section of the top menu bar will instead display your account name.
