Filters allow you to refine your results according to a set of major metadata categories and are accessed from the left-hand panel of the Portal. Select a filter in order to get the dropdown list of options. A total of five options are visible per page; to access more options use the pagination icons, or if you are looking for a particular option, a search bar is also available.
