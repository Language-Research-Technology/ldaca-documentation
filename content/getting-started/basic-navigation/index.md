### Home Page

There are three main sections of the Home Page; the top menu bar, the left panel and the main panel. TODO right panel? main panel?

<br>

##### Top Menu

<br>

![Home Page: Top Menu](/help_docs/portal01-topMenu.png)

<br>

The top menu of the home page contains some of the main features of the Portal:
- __LDaCA logo:__ Returns you to the home page from anywhere in the Portal. TODO is the word home next to it redundant?
- __Collections:__ Filters the main results section so that only collections are shown (rather than objects, files and notebooks as well).
- __Browse:__ Resets your results to the default settings (TODO check - this seems to work exactly the same as the LDaCA logo unless I'm missing something, is it redundant?)
- __Login:__ Takes you to the CILogon page where you can login in order to apply for access to collections or view your current access. For more details on this, see [Login](/accessing-data/login/).
- __Help:__ Provides more general information about the infrastructure the Portal was built with, as well as the Oni API functionalities. It also links back to this user guide for easy reference.

<br>

##### Left Panel

<br>

<br>

The left panel of the Portal home page allows you to refine your data query through the use of a search field and filtering. Hovering over the icon ![Information Icon](/help_docs/information.png) next to each filter will display tooltips related to that item. For more details on how to use the search and filter functions, see the pages [Search](/browsing-searching/search/) and [Filters](/browsing-searching/filters/).

<br>

##### Main Panel

<br>

![Home Page: Main Panel](/help_docs/portal01-mainFrame.png)

<br>

The main panel on the right of the home page allows you to view the top-level descriptions of collections, objects, files and notebooks in the Portal. The top row shows the total number of index entries or items; this total will reduce as you apply filters and search queries to your requests. Below this, there are options to ___Reset Search___, clearing the request of all filters and searches. The ___Sort By___ and ___Order By___ dropdowns can also be configured; to learn more about their usage, see [Sort and Order](/browsing-searching/sort-and-order/). Pagination options appear below this and are also accessible from the end of the page, with every page having a total of 10 results.

<br>

The results in the main panel contain a set of top-level descriptions:
- __Name:__ The name of the collection, object, file or notebook.
- __Type:__ TODO should this be updated to record type so it's in line with the filter name?
- __Language:__ The language(s) of the materials (including PrimaryMaterials, DerivedMaterials and Annotations) in this item.
- __Description:__ An abstract of the collection, object, file or notebook.
- __Members:__ The number of items within the given collection. TODO is there another name for this section?
- __Member of:__ The collection that an object, file or notebook is a part of.
