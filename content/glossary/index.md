Intro:
Thank you for taking part in this testing session. The aim of the session is for us to get information about how easy it is to use the app we are developing. The app is an interface which gives access to a repository of language data provided by the Language Data Commons of Australia (LDaCA). We expect a typical user of the interface to be a researcher or other person trying to find language data relevant to their interests.

This session will be recorded as audio and via screen capture. The data we collect is for internal use only; it will not be used in any published research. This means that recording is not subject to any university ethics procedure, but nonetheless we ask you to sign this release form indicating that you have been informed about the recording and agree to it.

We will begin this session by asking you to explore the interface for a while, then we will ask you to carry out some specific tasks, and we will end with a debriefing. During this session, we would like you to talk out loud about what you are doing: what do you see on the screen, what makes sense, what doesn't make sense, what actions you are carrying out (or trying to carry out). Here are a couple of examples of what we have in mind:-

- I wonder what that button does...
- I want to reset my page, I’ll try…
- I want to find results in X language so I’m going to look for somewhere that lets me narrow the results by language...

In a moment, we will start screen and audio recording and then we will ask you to start exploring the interface without any specific task. We would like you also to use this as an opportunity to practice voicing your activity - it can feel strange at first. The reason that we are asking you to do this is that it can provide us with important information about your intuitive responses and this can help us in improving the app. Are there any questions you would like to ask before we begin?

[Start screen and audio recording]

Please go ahead and start exploring, [NAME].

Now we will move to specific tasks. Although these tasks target particular pieces of information, what we are interested in is how you carry out the tasks and not whether you get a 'right' answer.

Using https://data-uat.ldaca.edu.au/search

On the right panel of the screen, you can see a listing of records. This list begins with collections; datasets containing related material. What can you find out about these collections without leaving the home page?

Text 1-073 1803 Flinders, Matthew in the COOEE collection has two versions available. Starting from the home page, can you find out how the start of those versions differ without using any searches or filters?

How many records contain the word ‘Australia’?
How many linguistic genres are represented in those records?

Does the phrase ‘public house’ appear in the data?
What did you try doing to answer this question? What method worked (if any)?

Can you find how many documents are in Vietnamese and contain the word ‘tin’? Can you do this without using filters?

Are there any records that include people talking about football? If you find any files, can you find the gender of the speakers?

Find a written transcription file about someone named Eugenie. What format is this file in? Can you access this file?

Outro:

1. What did you think of the app/website overall? (rating 1-5)
2. How did this app compare to similar apps you have used (e.g. library catalogue)?
3. Describe your experience in using the interface. Some aspects you might want to think about are:
   1. navigating the site.
   2. using the filters (left pane)
   3. using the search functions
   4. anything else which you noticed.
4. What was one thing which you liked about this product? Why?
5. What was one thing which you didn't like about this product? Why?
6. Would you use this product in your real life? In what circumstances?
7. In what ways do you think the site can be improved?
8. Is there anything else you would like to tell us about your experience with this interface?

Would you be happy to be contacted with follow-up questions?
Thank you etc. (don't forget the gift card!)

Crate-O is a browser-based editor for Research Object Crates (RO-Crate). RO-Crate is a flexible, developer-friendly approach to linked-data description and packaging.

Crate-O is designed to:
describe files on a user’s computer and to add contextual information about those files,
skip the files and describe abstract contextual entities such as in a Cultural Collection or an encyclopaedia, or
annotate existing resources elsewhere on the web.

Crate-O works only with Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge at this stage as it describes files on the user's computer, and saves RO-Crate metadata there. We will be releasing versions that work with online resources directly which will be compatible with other browsers (see the Roadmap).

While the current version of Crate-O is designed for editing self-contained RO-Crates (and works fine with crates containing tens of thousands of entities), our roadmap includes editing fragments of larger linked-data resources, and integration with Arkisto repositories such as the Oni repository, data API and search portal.

Crate-O is currently developed by the Language Data Commons of Australia (LDaCA), under the guidance of Peter Sefton as technical lead. If the tool is adopted in other contexts (we are in talks with a few groups about this) then we aim to establish a steering committee/reference group to help guide development.
