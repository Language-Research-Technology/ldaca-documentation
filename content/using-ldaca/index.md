# Purpose #
Data governance defines policies, roles, responsibilities and procedures for ongoing use and storage of data, as well as for access to data. Effective data governance maximises sustainability, while ensuring data integrity and protecting research participants. Long-term sustainability requires a data management plan.

This document provides guidance on some components of data governance that are key to a data management plan, including access conditions, licensing, persistent identifiers, and metadata. The principles below are those employed by LDaCA, but they are widely applicable and represent best practice for data governance, in accordance with the FAIR and CARE principles.

In each section, you will find a thought bubble marking some questions for reflection that will help you start to explore these data governance topics. This content is designed as guidance for Data Stewards considering how to manage their data into the future.

Though developed specifically with Indigenous Peoples in mind, the principles are applicable more generally.
FAIR Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) | Four key principles addressing data management and stewardship, developed in 2016 with the aim of supporting the discovery and reuse of research data.
Data collection | A set of data collected under similar conditions and brought together in a shared framework.
Data governance | The policies and processes by which data is managed through its life cycle to ensure the quality, reliability, security, and sustainability of the data.
Data Steward | An individual or organisation with the authority to make decisions regarding the named data collection. In some cases, the Data Steward may also be the copyright owner.
